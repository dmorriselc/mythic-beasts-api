Some samples of PowerShell for connecting to Mythic Beasts API

Mythic-Beasts are a UK based hosting and domain registration company. They have an API you can use to manage your domains, DNS and other products. 

Their documentation is tailored towards using Linux, which is fine but we use Windows/PowerShell so I came up with some internal scripts for our 
purposes and decided to share some examples for other users.
